@OTHER{Mahlke1994,
  abstract = {Branch instructions are recognized as a major impediment to exploiting
	instruction level parallelism. Even with sophisticated branch prediction
	techniques, many frequently executed branches remain difficult to
	predict. An architecture supporting predicated execution may allow
	the compiler to remove many of these hard-to-predict branches, reducing
	the number of branch mispredictions and thereby improving performance.
	We present an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of those branches
	which are frequently mispredicted and examine the effectiveness of
	an advanced compiler to eliminate these branches. Over the benchmarks
	studied, an average of 27% of the dynamic branches and 56% of the
	dynamic branch mispredictions are eliminated with predicated execution
	support.},
